{"id": "fire", "description": "Current global burned area products already exist but the Fire_cci project aims to improve consistency using better algorithms for both pre-processing and burned area detection while incorporating error characterisation in their product. The project focuses on the key variable: burned area. It will incorporate active fire observations as a supplemental variable to improve detection of burned area across varying biomes.", "stac_version": "1.1.0", "links": [{"rel": "items", "type": "application/geo+json", "href": "https://api.stac.164.30.69.113.nip.io/collections/fire/items"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://api.stac.164.30.69.113.nip.io/"}, {"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://api.stac.164.30.69.113.nip.io/"}, {"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://api.stac.164.30.69.113.nip.io/collections/fire"}], "stac_extensions": [], "title": "Fire", "type": "Collection", "assets": {"thumbnail": {"href": "https://brand.esa.int/files/2020/05/ESA_logo_2020_Deep-1024x643.jpg", "type": "image/jpg", "roles": ["thumbnail"]}}, "license": "other", "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[-180, -90, 180, 90]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [["2001-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2019-12-31T00:00:00Z"]]}}, "keywords": ["Fire", "fire", "ESACCI"], "providers": [], "summaries": {"project": ["Fire"]}}
