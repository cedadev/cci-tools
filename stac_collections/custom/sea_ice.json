{"id": "sea_ice", "description": "The ESA CCI Sea Ice project will combine and extend ongoing research to develop improved and validated timeseries of ice concentration and ice thickness for use in climate research. Since sea ice is a sensitive climate indicator with large seasonal and regional variability, the climate research community require long-term and regular observations of the key ice parameters in both Arctic and Antarctic. The project includes representatives from the scientific user community and climate research programmes to validate the ice concentration and ice thickness retrievals provided by the EO science team.", "stac_version": "1.1.0", "links": [{"rel": "items", "type": "application/geo+json", "href": "https://api.stac.164.30.69.113.nip.io/collections/sea_ice/items"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://api.stac.164.30.69.113.nip.io/"}, {"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://api.stac.164.30.69.113.nip.io/"}, {"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://api.stac.164.30.69.113.nip.io/collections/sea_ice"}], "stac_extensions": [], "title": "Sea Ice", "type": "Collection", "assets": {"thumbnail": {"href": "https://brand.esa.int/files/2020/05/ESA_logo_2020_Deep-1024x643.jpg", "type": "image/jpg", "roles": ["thumbnail"]}}, "license": "other", "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[-180, -90, 180, 90]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [["1978-10-25T00:00:00Z", "2025-03-12T00:00:00Z"]]}}, "keywords": ["Sea Ice", "sea_ice", "ESACCI"], "providers": [], "summaries": {"project": ["Sea Ice"]}}
