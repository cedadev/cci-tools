{"id": "soil_moisture", "description": "The important role of soil moisture for the environment and climate system is well known. Soil moisture influences hydrological and agricultural processes, runoff generation, drought development and many other processes. It also impacts on the climate system through atmospheric feedbacks. Soil moisture is a source of water for evapotranspiration over the continents, and is involved in both the water and the energy cycles. Soil moisture was recognised as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) in 2010.", "stac_version": "1.1.0", "stac_extensions": [], "title": "Soil Moisture", "type": "Collection", "license": "other", "links": [{"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://api.stac-master.rancher2.130.246.130.221.nip.io/"}, {"rel": "aggregate", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://api.stac-master.rancher2.130.246.130.221.nip.io/collections/soil_moisture/aggregate"}, {"rel": "aggregations", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://api.stac-master.rancher2.130.246.130.221.nip.io/collections/soil_moisture/aggregations"}, {"rel": "items", "type": "application/geo+json", "href": "https://api.stac-master.rancher2.130.246.130.221.nip.io/collections/soil_moisture/items"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://api.stac-master.rancher2.130.246.130.221.nip.io/collections/cci"}, {"rel": "queryables", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://api.stac-master.rancher2.130.246.130.221.nip.io/collections/soil_moisture/queryables"}, {"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://api.stac-master.rancher2.130.246.130.221.nip.io/collections/soil_moisture"}], "assets": {"thumbnail": {"roles": ["thumbnail"], "href": "https://brand.esa.int/files/2020/05/ESA_logo_2020_Deep-1024x643.jpg", "type": "image/jpg"}}, "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[-180, -90, 180, 90]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [["1991-08-05T00:00:00Z", "2025-03-31T00:00:00Z"]]}}, "keywords": ["ESACCI", "Soil Moisture", "soil_moisture"], "providers": [], "summaries": {"project": ["Soil Moisture"]}}
