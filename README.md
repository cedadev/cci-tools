## Add Opensearch Location

The add opensearch location script enables adding the `kerchunk_location` attribute to all files for a given kerchunk/zarr product. This script requires the path to a filelist, cloud format (kerchunk/zarr) and location of the remote file.

## Build CCI Collections

Builds all CCI STAC collections using the ODP Config file generated by Ambient as a template. This will update the existing STAC records with any changes from opensearch, but will not reset added links or items to the live STAC index. Be aware that any changes made to collections may not be respected, where they are overridden by opensearch.

## Delete Collections

Delete collections, items or nested collections from the STAC index, including removing links in the parent collection if provided. This means the STAC index is not cluttered with non-existent collections where a parent collection doesn't know a child collection has been deleted.

## Shell

Open a shell with the client and auth objects loaded for quick access to the STAC API

## Update Collection

Upload/replace a collection in the STAC index from a local file. This includes merging the sets of `links` so as not to break parent-child relations.
