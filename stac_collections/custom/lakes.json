This includes aiming for the longest period of combined satellite observations by designing and operating processing chains, designed to be ultimately feature in a sustainable production system. The Lakes project covers multiple variables (Lake Water Level, Lake Water Extent, Lake Surface Water temperature, Lake Ice Cover and Thickness, and Lake Surface Reflectance).
