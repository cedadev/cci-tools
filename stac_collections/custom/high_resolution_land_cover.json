{"id": "high_resolution_land_cover", "description": "The primary objective of High Resolution Land Cover CCI is to study and investigate the role of the spatial resolution of land cover and land cover change in supporting climate modelling research at regional scale.  It aims at improving the understanding of the interaction between climate and land cover while increasing the spatial resolution of 1 order of magnitude (from 300m to 10-30m) with respect to the Land Cover CCI", "stac_version": "1.1.0", "links": [{"rel": "items", "type": "application/geo+json", "href": "https://api.stac.164.30.69.113.nip.io/collections/high_resolution_land_cover/items"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://api.stac.164.30.69.113.nip.io/"}, {"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://api.stac.164.30.69.113.nip.io/"}, {"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://api.stac.164.30.69.113.nip.io/collections/high_resolution_land_cover"}], "stac_extensions": [], "title": "High Resolution Land Cover", "type": "Collection", "assets": {"thumbnail": {"href": "https://brand.esa.int/files/2020/05/ESA_logo_2020_Deep-1024x643.jpg", "type": "image/jpg", "roles": ["thumbnail"]}}, "license": "other", "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[-180, -90, 180, 90]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [["1990-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2019-12-31T00:00:00Z"]]}}, "keywords": ["high_resolution_land_cover", "High Resolution Land Cover", "ESACCI"], "providers": [], "summaries": {"project": ["High Resolution Land Cover"]}}
