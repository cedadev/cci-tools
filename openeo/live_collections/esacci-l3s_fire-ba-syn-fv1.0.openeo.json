    "description": "The ESA Fire Disturbance Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project has produced maps of global burned area derived from satellite observations. The Sentinel-3 SYN Fire_cci v1.0 pixel product is distributed as 6 continental tiles and is based upon surface reflectance data from the OLCI and SLSTR instruments (combined as the Synergy (SYN) product) onboard the Sentinel-3 A&B satellites. This information is complemented by VIIRS thermal information. This product, called FireCCIS310 for short, is currently available for 2019, but it is foreseen to be extended for additional years.\r\n\r\nThe FireCCIS310 Pixel product described here includes maps at 0.002777-degree (approx. 300m) resolution. Burned area (BA) information includes 3 individual files, packed in a compressed tar.gz file: date of BA detection (labelled JD), the confidence level (CL, a probability value estimating the confidence that a pixel is actually burned), and the land cover (LC) information as defined in the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Land Cover v2.1.1 product.     An unpacked version of the data is also available. For further information on the product and its format see the Product User Guide in the linked documentation.",
